This repository will be use for the Madison College Python Scripting students.
# My name is Alex Hickel and this repository will be used for the course project. During the course project we will be adding new functionality to our scripts in order to process Apache Log entries. The Apache log entries come from Apache web servers. We will summarize the data in the log to identitfy potential security threats, and deal with those threats by using different web services.
